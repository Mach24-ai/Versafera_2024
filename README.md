# Versafera Overview

As part of the Hack4Earth competition, the Versafera project leverages the PVTrace ray tracing simulator to analyze the efficiency of a polyangular sphere in optimizing light trapping. The simulation showcases how light interacts within the Versafera product, enhancing its absorption and partial reflection by the internal semiconductor wall to improve energy capture.

# Features

Advanced Ray Tracing: Uses the PVTrace library for detailed simulation of light behavior within the sphere.
Polyangular Sphere Geometry: Examines the advantages of spherical shapes in maximizing light capture from multiple angles.
Reflective and Absorptive Analysis: Investigates the interactions between light, internal mirrors, and semiconductor surfaces for optimal performance.
Results

# The simulation aims to provide valuable insights into:

The light-trapping efficiency of the polyangular sphere design.
The effectiveness of internal mirrors in reflecting light toward the semiconductor.
The absorption characteristics of the semiconductor wall inside Versafera.
